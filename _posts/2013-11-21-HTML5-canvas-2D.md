### Show me the world

Now that we have in memory :

 * The useful informations to display the level : blocks and sprite positions, name of textures, starting position of moto, ending position of level, etc. (*cf.* [Level Parsing](/2013/08/20/level-parsing.html))

 * The assets : images for sprites and textures for blocks (*cf.* [Assets Management](/2013/11/20/assets-management.html))

We can start to display the level in a HTML5 canvas.

Canvas, and in our case Canvas 2D, is a HTML technology that you can use to make similar things than Adobe Flash. What it means is that you don't need anymore an external plugin to make a game works in the browser. It's now part of the W3C that defines the protocol/structure of the web.

> **Note** We use Canvas 2D in oppositon to Canvas 3D. Canvas 3D is the same HTML ```<canvas></canvas>``` tag but the drawings on the canvas are made using WebGL. WebGL is a sub-part of OpenGL and allows you to create 3D objects with the support of your GPU. Since XMoto is full-2D, we don't need WebGL and, by extension, what we call Canvas 3D.
