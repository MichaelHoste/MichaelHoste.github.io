title: 3. Level parsing (.lvl files)
---

We want to use the 3000+ existing levels of XMoto so we need to undestand how the .lvl files work.
First, we need to create a big parser. This is useful because we want to get the information from the file, and store in into the memory of the computer (browser).
When the info is on memory, we can use it really fast to draw the informations on the screen.
This is a first step.
